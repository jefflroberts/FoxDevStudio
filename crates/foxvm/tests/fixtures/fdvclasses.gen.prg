* Writes fdvclasses.vcx, the class library the tests read.
*
* A `.vcx` is a table with a memo file beside it, so one can be written without the Class
* Designer - which waits for a person and so can be asked nothing in a test run. Run this with
* `vfp9.exe fdvclasses.gen.prg` in a scratch folder and copy fdvclasses.vcx and fdvclasses.vct
* into `golden` beside it. What the run writes into out.txt is the product reading its own file
* back, which is what says the result is a class library and not merely a table.
*
* Three things the product insists on, each measured by leaving it out and watching it refuse:
* the first record stamps the file (COMMENT / Class / VERSION = 3.00) or the file is "invalid";
* RESERVED2 on a class row counts the records the class spans, or its members are not read at
* all; and RESERVED3 lists the members the class adds of its own, or a property written in the
* memo is "not found" on the object. A custom character property is written unquoted, which is
* how the designer writes one - quoted, the quotes come back as part of the value.
