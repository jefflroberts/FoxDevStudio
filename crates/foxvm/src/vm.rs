//! The bytecode interpreter.
//!
//! # Fibers and frames
//! Every running program/method is a *fiber*: a value stack, a frame stack, the TRY handlers
//! installed by its frames and the bookkeeping for a pending host request. `step` runs a fiber
//! until it finishes, fails or yields a `HostRequest`; the scheduler performs the request and
//! calls `resume` (or `resume_error`) before stepping again. Several fibers can be parked at
//! once (READ EVENTS in one, a Click method running in another).
//!
//! A frame owns its local slots, its PRIVATE variables, `THIS`, its WITH stack and the argument
//! list. `LoadName` walks the privates of the current frame, then of every caller frame
//! (dynamic scoping), then the PUBLIC globals; locals are slots and never visible to callees.
//!
//! # Runtime compilation
//! `&macro`, `&cmd` lines and `EVALUATE()` compile their text against the current function's
//! slot names and run it in an *inline* frame: a frame that has no storage of its own and
//! forwards every locals / privates / WITH / argument access to its owner frame (so slot numbers
//! in the compiled code match, and a snippet may create privates in the owner). The owner's
//! locals vector is temporarily extended for the temporaries the inline code needs and cut back
//! when the inline frame returns. Compiled inline modules are cached per (kind, owner function,
//! text).
//!
//! # Errors
//! An error unwinds to the innermost TRY handler of the fiber (whichever frame installed it):
//! frames above it are popped, the value stack is cut back to the depth at `TryPush`, and
//! execution continues at the CATCH block (a finally-only handler is installed for it) or at the
//! FINALLY block with the error pending for `EndFinally`. Without a handler, `ON ERROR` text is
//! compiled as a snippet and run in a new frame; when it returns the failing frame continues at
//! its next statement. Otherwise the fiber ends with `Step::Error`. `CATCH TO var` receives the
//! error *message* (error objects arrive in phase 6); `BuiltinCtx::last_error` has the full error.
