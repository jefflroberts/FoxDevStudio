//! The boundary between the VM and the environment that owns forms, dialogs and files.
//!
//! Two halves, on purpose: `Host` is synchronous and side-effect free (property reads, member
//! classification, output), implemented by JS imports in the wasm build. Anything with a side
//! effect or that may block (setting a property, calling a method, MESSAGEBOX, DO FORM, READ
//! EVENTS, file I/O) is a `HostRequest` the VM *yields*; the scheduler performs it while the
//! VM is off the stack and then resumes the fiber with the result. This is what keeps the
//! wasm-bindgen object non-re-entrant and makes modal dialogs work without threads.
