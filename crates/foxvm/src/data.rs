//! Work areas and cursors: FoxPro's table state, on the VM side of the host/VM split.
//!
//! A cursor never holds a file. It holds the table's header, a window of raw record bytes it last
//! asked the host for, and the record it is sitting on, decoded. That shape is what keeps field
//! reads cheap: moving the record pointer may cost a round trip to the host, but reading `custno`
//! afterwards is a lookup in memory, so an expression that touches ten fields costs nothing extra.
//!
//! Records are numbered from 1 and counted in `u64`. Visual FoxPro stops at 2 GB per table
//! because it does this arithmetic in signed 32-bit; the point of the split is not to.
